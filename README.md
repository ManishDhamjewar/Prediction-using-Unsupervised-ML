# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
Data Science and Business Analytics Task-2
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually

ALGORITHM USED - K-Means
K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.

Tools used :- Python(Jupyter Notebook)
